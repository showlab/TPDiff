# TPDiff

This repository is the official implementation of [TPDiff](). We will release the code soon.

<em> TPDiff reduces the training cost of video diffusion models by 50% and accelerates inference by 1.5 times. </em>


![Overview_v7](https://github.com/showlab/TPDiff/blob/main/assets/teaser.png)

Our method employs progressive frame rates, which utilizes full frame rate only in the final stage as shown in (a) and (b), thereby largely optimizing computational efficiency in both training and inference shown in (c).
